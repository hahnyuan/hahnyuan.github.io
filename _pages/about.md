Hello! I'm Zhihang Yuan. I received my Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2017 and my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2022 under the guidance of Professor Guangyu Sun. Currently, I am mainly engaged in Efficient AI, focusing on the model compression and inference acceleration of neural networks, as well as the collaborative optimization of software and hardware for deep learning.

In 2021, I joined Houmo AI, a startup specializing in AI accelerator focusing on Computing in Memory (CIM) technique. During my time there, I participated in the design of the AI accelerators. I also led the development of quantization algorithms and tools.
In 2024, I continued my career as an innovative algorithm researcher at Infini-AI.

我于2017年获得北京大学学士学位，于2022年获得北京大学计算机学院博士学位，博士导师为孙广宇长聘副教授。我专注于高效AI相关的研究工作，研究方向为神经网络的量化及推理加速、深度学习的软硬件协同优化。
2021年加入后摩智能担任资深算法工程师，参与了数字存算AI加速器设计。
2024年加入无问芯穹担任创新算法研究员。
喜欢走走，曾参加过北京大学自行车协会2014年暑期远征和北京大学山鹰社2022年英吉沙科考。
